            I believe I always loved Michelle Obama. Her grace and dignity
            always seemed to come as a gift from above. Her spirit is so
            incredibly deep and strong. The stories from her childhood, her
            brother, her neighborhood, her family, inform us in a brilliant
            voice about what it was like in the place and time she grew up.
            Michelle Obama has the empathy and the depth of character so missing
            in her media portrayal. I always felt worried that we were
            suffocating her. But there is a Michelle Obama who is bigger than
            the words on a page. She knows our pains, and she understands our
            lives. And we know her in this book. In this most private book, we
            know her in a way we could not have otherwise. Interesting that
            nothing here surprises me, it only affirms what I felt like I know:
            Michelle Obama is a person like us. She worked and suffered and
            overcame. Her storytelling skills are exquisite. It left me a little
            breathless to hear her voice, unfettered and real. I love the
            photographs.

            An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2014: Does the world need yet
            another novel about WWII? It does when the novel is as inventive and
            beautiful as this one by Anthony Doerr. In fact, All the Light We
            Cannot See--while set mostly in Germany and France before and during
            the war--is not really a “war novel”. Yes, there is fear and
            fighting and disappearance and death, but the author’s focus is on
            the interior lives of his two characters. Marie Laure is a blind
            14-year-old French girl who flees to the countryside when her father
            disappears from Nazi-occupied Paris. Werner is a gadget-obsessed
            German orphan whose skills admit him to a brutal branch of Hitler
            Youth. Never mind that their paths don’t cross until very late in
            the novel, this is not a book you read for plot (although there is a
            wonderful, mysterious subplot about a stolen gem). This is a book
            you read for the beauty of Doerr’s writing-- “Abyss in her gut,
            desert in her throat, Marie-Laure takes one of the cans of
            food…”--and for the way he understands and cherishes the magical
            obsessions of childhood. Marie Laure and Werner are never quaint or
            twee. Instead they are powerful examples of the way average people
            in trying times must decide daily between morality and survival.

            An Amazon Best Book of February 2019: The Silent Patient by Alex
            Michaelides feels like it could be the big psychological thriller
            debut of 2019. The novel takes a few chapters to clear its throat
            and set the plot in motion, but once the tracks are laid it’s full
            steam ahead. Alicia Berenson is one-half of a glamorous couple—she’s
            an artist married to her fashion photographer husband, Gabriel. But
            when Gabriel returns home late one night, she shoots him five times
            in the face and refuses to speak again. Now she is being held in an
            institution outside London called the Grove. When a psychotherapist
            named Theo Faber becomes obsessed with her case, he finds his way to
            the Grove to treat her. Dark twists and delightful turns follow,
            secrets (and a diary) are revealed, and you will likely find
            yourself racing to the end.--Chris Schluep, the Amazon Book Review
            --This text refers to the hardcover edition.

            “Riveting…finely drawn…The Whistler centers on an elaborate

            syndicate and a crooked judge skimming a small fortune from the
            tribal casino’s monthly haul.” --The New York Times Book Review “A
            main character who’s a seriously appealing woman...a whistle-blower
            who secretly calls attention to corruption...a strong and
            frightening sense of place...Grisham’s on his game.” —Janet Maslin,
            The New York Times “A fascinating look at judicial corruption…an
            entirely convincing story and one of Grisham’s best. I can’t think
            of another major American novelist since Sinclair Lewis who has so
            effectively targeted social and political ills in our society. In
            Grisham’s case, it is time at least to recognize that at his best he
            is not simply the author of entertaining legal thrillers but an
            important novelistic critic of our society. In more than 30 novels,
            he has often used his exceptional storytelling skills to take a hard
            look at injustice and corruption in the legal world and in our
            society as a whole.” --Patrick Anderson, The Washington Post
            “Grisham's latest involves the rich and powerful and an abuse of the
            justice system. Grisham novels are crowd-pleasers because he knows
            how to satisfy readers who want to see injustice crushed, and
            justice truly prevails for those who cannot buy influence.”
            --Associated Press “Grisham has become an institution. For more than
            25 years now he’s been our guide to the byways and backwaters of our
            legal system, superb in particular at ferreting out its
            vulnerabilities and dramatizing their abuse in gripping style. He
            excels at describing injustice and corruption. Grisham’s legal
            knowledge is impressive, and his ability to convey it unparalleled
            in popular fiction.” --USA Today --This text refers to the paperback
            edition.
